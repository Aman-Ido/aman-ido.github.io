        Why do this?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Good day or should I say Good Morning to the respected reader. I wanted to create this site because <br>
        previously I was just using GIMP - photo editor to manually place letters on and make a bitmap image<br>
        <i>(And.. I know I'm a bit foolish to do so)</i>. 
        <ul>
          <li>At first I thought of making Bitmap Font Image Generator in SDL/C++.</li>
          <li>But again, I also wanted to upload some youtube videos, and making it in html/javascript had more content on it.</li>
          <li>This site will probably have a advertisement for such purpose (as I will probably put youtube video on how to show ads on sites)</li>
        </ul>
